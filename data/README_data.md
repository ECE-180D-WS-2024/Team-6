## Data Collected - March 2024

### Gesture Recognition 
- `imu_data.txt` contains the tests performed to improve the recognition of our catch gesture. After adjusting IMU value thresholds and the length of our sliding window, we have a near 100% accuracy rate of catch gesture recognition. 
- `gesture_demo_data.txt` contains the IMU data collected while filming the demo video for our winter final presentation. It shows that our gesture recognition is robust against random movements of the arm but can successfully recognize the catch gesture. 

### Speech Recognition 
`recognized_speech.txt` contains a speech recognition log. Different words are said at different distances to the computer. We have approximately a 50% accuracy rate with the current approach.
